# Forecasting time series with lag-llama. 

## This Jupyter notebook applies META's lag-llama to forecasting stock market time series. This is the first step towards applying it to a broader set of time series. The current notebook is still unfinished - I am planning to extend it with a more rigorous fine-tuning pipeline (through the variation of a broader set of hyperparameters). The notebook should be self-explanatory. 

#### For re-producibility one should ensure that a virtual environment satisfying the package/version requirements in the file "requirements.txt" is created.
